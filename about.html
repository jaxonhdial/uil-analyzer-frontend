        <h1>About UIL Analyzer</h1>

        <p>
            <strong>UIL Analyzer</strong> is a searchable and filterable archive designed
            to make past UIL academic competition results more accessible and easier
            to explore.
        </p>

        <p>
            UIL academic results have historically been fragmented across static
            archives and year-specific result pages with limited filtering options.
            UIL Analyzer centralizes this information into a single modern interface
            that allows competitors, coaches, and teams to explore historical data
            in meaningful ways.
        </p>

        <p>
            UIL Analyzer is built by a competitor, for competitors, with a focus on
            clarity, accessibility, and long-term usability.
        </p>

        <h2>Core Features</h2>

        <h3>Archives</h3>
        <p>
            The Archives page combines the benefits of the traditional UIL archive
            system, where results were accessible on a single page, with the recency
            and availability of SpeechWire results.
        </p>
        <p>
            Users can filter results by year, event, conference, and competition
            level, making it easier to locate specific contests and placements.
        </p>

        <h3>Virtual Contest <em>(Coming Soon)</em></h3>
        <p>
            The Virtual Contest feature allows users to combine results from multiple
            archives into a single simulated contest.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Compare how you would place across all districts in a region</li>
            <li>Compare one school’s performance across different conferences</li>
            <li>See how you would have performed at a contest from a previous year</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Competitor & School Search <em>(Coming Soon)</em></h3>
        <p>
            Search for a competitor or school and view every recorded appearance
            across past years and competitions. This feature is designed to make
            long-term performance trends easier to identify.
        </p>

        <h3>Live Results <em>(Coming Soon)</em></h3>
        <p>
            View which events have posted results for a given year in real time.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Green:</strong> Results are available</li>
            <li><strong>Red:</strong> Results have not yet been posted</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Academic Alignments <em>(Coming Soon)</em></h3>
        <p>
            Search for a school to see its district and region placement, along
            with all other schools in the same district. This simplifies alignment
            lookups that are typically scattered across multiple UIL documents.
